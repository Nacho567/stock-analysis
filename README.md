# stock-analysis
Module 2: VBA

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

In this project we helped Steve analyze stocks in Excel/VBA so that he could give his parents some good advice on what to invest in.

## **Results**

As the following pictures show, the refactored code runs faster than the original one did!

**Refactored Code**

### **Summary**

Refactoring code can have many advantages. The biggest one being that the code runs faster while simultaneously doing more. Making anything more efficient helps speed the process up and cuts resources, which can help save time and money for any person or business involved. With businesses especially, time is money so that can have an exponential return rate of savings. One part of refactoring could lead to an advantage or disadvantage, depending on how it's done (or who does it), and that is when the code is rewritten it might get more or less complicated. The hope is less complicated, but if your coder doesn't make proper notes or throws in magic numbers it could lead to problems down the road.

Applying this to the VBA script, we gained more advantages than disadvantages. It ran faster, we noted what and why we put the code in, and it could be easily rewritten to be used for future stock analysis or another analysis of prices of something over time.
